            Anytime Podcast Player supports Podcasting 2.0 transcripts, allowing you to search or
            follow along to a podcast episode.<br/><br/>
            Transcripts are provided by the podcast host.

        Why is there no transcript for this episode?
    </h3>
    <div>
        <p>
        There are several reasons why Anytime may be unable to display a transcript for the episode:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The host's provider does not support Podcasting 2.0 transcripts.
            </li>
            <li>
                The host has not generated a transcript for this episode.
            </li>
            <li>
                The host has not generated a transcript for this episode that Anytime can support
                (currently SRT and JSON formats).
            </li>
            <li>
                The host has released a transcript since Anytime last checked for updates.
            </li>
        </ul>
